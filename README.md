* Note: *GitHub* would not let me upload the all of my game files; however, I was able to upload the assets folder which does contain the ECS code I wrote.
  I tried other methods of putting the large files onto here like *git lfs*, but they did not work. If you do need more than the my assets folder, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
